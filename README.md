Amazon reviews for sentiment Analysis ( Deep Learning Approach )
Ecommerce companies like Amazon, Walmart, Kroger, etc have a lot of customer review data which they can leverage to make better recommendations, analyze products and sellers and a lot of more stuffs. Fortunately, machine learning and deep learning come to the resue in order to make state of the art sentiment predictions on the reviews. The review data is ofcourse unstructured which can be modelled using different techniques.

Here's a deep learning approach that I am gonna use to classify the sentiments of all the Amazon reviews as positive or a negative sentiment. The dataset has about 4 million reviews and has been taken from kaggle.
